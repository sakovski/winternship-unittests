# Unit Tests practise

## 1. Add JUnit 5 and Mockito Dependencies

## 2. Get familiar with the code and play with the app :)

## 3. Add tests to VoteRepositoryTest and VoteServiceTest classes.
All existing methods in these classes, with all possible paths should be tested. 
Hint: use Mockito to test the VoteServiceTest class.
